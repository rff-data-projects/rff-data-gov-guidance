## FAQ

#### What types of files can I store in my repository?
In general, git works well with:

* __Small files.__ It is not advisable to store large data files in git, because it makes the repository large and subsequent operations get slow and unwieldy. For storing large files, see the [Storage Options section](../data-management/storage-options.qmd)
* __Human-readable files.__  One of the biggest perks of version control is the ability to see specific changes to files.
That feature only works for files composed of human-readable characters, examples of which include comma-separated values (.csv) and plain text (.txt), as well as source code.
However, there are some commonly-used filetypes that are not human-readable, and thus do not work very well with version control, including:

  * Any Microsoft office format (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx, etc.)
  * MATLAB notebooks (.mlx)

#### What if there is a file in my local repository that I don’t want in the remote repository?
Great question!
If I may want to add that file to the repository later, I could simply avoid staging it for current commit, and stage it when it is ready later.
If that file or folder should never be tracked, you can also create a file called `.gitignore` in the repository.

#### What if I don’t have anyone who can review my code or pull request?
The importance and benefits of code review was presented in the Software Quality section of the guidance <TODO: LINK TO SUBSECTION>.
If you don’t have anyone working on a project with you who is available to review your code, feel free to reach out to <TODO: figure out if this is something we can support>

## Tips

### Commit Messages

If you want to learn to write better commit messages, [this is a great resource!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/)

### `.gitignore` Files

Git provides us with the option of including a file that specifies files, filetypes, or folders, to automatically exclude from version control.
Files covered by the `.gitignore` file will not show up when you check the `git status`, but they may still be manually added and committed.
These `.gitignore` files can be life-savers, preventing the user from accidentally committing large files, which can create problems down the road.

Inside the file is simply the names of the file(s), folder(s), or file extension types (i.e. `*.log`) that Git will ignore.
Generally, it is good to ignore files/folders that get automatically generated by existing scripts, are too big for Git, or are not relevant to other users of the repository.
Here are some examples of files that you may consider adding to a `.gitignore` file:

* a folder containing intermediate data files
* a folder containing dependencies that get downloaded using a script
* a project file created by a code editor

The easiest way to set up a `.gitignore` file is to select the template corresponding to your desired programming language upon [creation of the repository.](./tutorial-basics.qmd#creating-a-repository-in-github)
However, it is always possible to create your own manually later on, or borrow from [GitHub's `.gitignore` templates.](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main)

### Branch Naming

[Here](https://medium.com/@abhay.pixolo/naming-conventions-for-git-branches-a-cheatsheet-8549feca2534) is a great resource for learning more about branch naming conventions.

### Tags

Sometimes it is helpful to name a specific commit of a repository.  For example, say you have a version of the repository that you used to generate analysis for a publication.  You can easily use the `git tag` command to "name" that specific commit.  For example,

```bash
git tag <tag-name>
git push --tags
```

### Aliases

An __Alias__ is like creating a shortcut for a git command so that you don't have to type out the whole command.  

For example, we type `git status` fairly often and it would be nice to simply type `git st`.  We can tell Git that we want to create an `alias` called `git st` that simply executes `git status` instead.  Here is how we tell Git Bash to save that into its configuration file.

```
git config --global alias.st status
```

#### Commit Message Alias

This alias makes it easier to type a commit message without opening notepad.  

##### Setup

```
git config --global alias.cm 'commit -m'
```

##### Usage

```
git cm "Commit message here"
```

#### Tree Visualization

Git Bash offers tools to visualize commits/branches.  Usually these are based on the command `git log`, which has __many__ different options for customization.  Below is a customized `git log` command that is nicely color-coded, shows user, date, and commit message.

```
git log --graph --oneline --exclude=origin/gh-pages --branches --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h %Cred%ad %Cblue%an%Cgreen%d %Creset%s' --date=short
```
![Git Branch Visualization](../../images/git-tree-visualization.png)\

As you can see, it prints the commit hash, the date of the commit, the author, the name of the branch, and the commit message, as well as the branching structure at the far left.

##### Setup

To make an alias for it with the name `tree`, enter the following command in Git Bash:

```
git config --global alias.tree "log --graph --oneline --exclude=origin/gh-pages --branches --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h %Cred%ad %Cblue%an%Cgreen%d %Creset%s' --date=short"
```

##### Usage

Now, to print the visualization, simply enter:

```
git tree
git tree -10     # this option makes it only print the latest 10 commits.
```
