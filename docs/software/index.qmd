title: Software Quality
---

Due to the computational nature of our research, software development (writing code and scripts) is a primary component of everyday work at RFF. Best practices in scientific coding are designed to:

- ensure **accuracy** and minimize errors,
- enhance code **readability** and **flexibility**,
- improve **reproducibility**, and
- improve **efficiency** in computation.

The other components of this guidance ([Data Management](../data-management/index.qmd) and [Version Control](../version-control/index.qmd)) are all part of practices for high-quality software. This section focuses specifically on the code-writing process, providing general principles to promote robust coding practices while recognizing that best practices vary by discipline and by software/language.
