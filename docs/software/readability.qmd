Readable code reduces the time collaborators and future developers spend deciphering complex code and ensures continuity even if the original author is unavailable. To accomplish this, we recommend:

1. **modularizing code**,  
2. using **consistent code style**, and  
3. providing clear **in-code documentation**.

## Modularizing code

Modularizing code refers to breaking the script into small, self-contained, and logically organized blocks, each with a clear and focused purpose. This approach makes the structure of the code more transparent to readers.  

Each code block should be accompanied by descriptive in-line comments explaining its role and expected behavior. Modularization also helps with debugging: when something goes wrong, you can isolate and fix the issue in a single location rather than combing through the entire codebase.

## Consistent code style

Code style refers to the conventions that govern how code is written and formatted. This includes:

- formatting choices (e.g., indentation, spacing, line length),
- naming conventions (for variables, functions, datasets, etc.), and
- documentation and commenting practices.

While personal preferences vary, **the key to readability is consistency**.

Below are established style guides relevant to programming languages commonly used at RFF:

- R: [*Tidyverse Style Guide*](https://style.tidyverse.org/) by Hadley Wickham  
- Python: [*Google Python Style Guide*](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md)  
- Stata: [*Suggestions on Stata programming style*](https://www.stata-journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=pr0018) by Nicholas Fox  
- Other languages: [*Google style guides for other languages*](https://google.github.io/styleguide/)

In particular, we recommend using **consistent, distinctive, and meaningful names** for variables, functions, datasets, and files:

- **Variable or object** names should be descriptive of their content, avoiding overly vague or generic terms (e.g., `discount_rate` instead of `val`)
- **Function** names should describe their action or output (e.g., `calculate_average_price()`). 
- **Datasets and files** should follow a systematic naming pattern that includes relevant identifiers (e.g., `county_population_2022.csv` instead of `data_final.csv`). *(See the [Naming folders, files, and scripts](docs/data-management/organization.html#naming-folders-files-and-scripts) subsection under Data Management.)*

## In-code documentation

In-code documentation refers to comments written directly within the source code to explain its purpose, functionality, and usage. We recommend incorporating three types of documentation:

1. **Script headers**  
   Include a header at the top of each script outlining key metadata such as the script’s objective, author, and start date.

2. **Block-level comments**  
   Use comments to describe the intent and logic of each major code block.

3. **Inline comments**  
   Add comments on individual lines of code, especially when the functionality is not obvious or when there are potential limitations.
