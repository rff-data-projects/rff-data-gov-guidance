## What is Version Control?

```{=html}
<style>
.semi-transparent {
  opacity: 0.4;
}
</style>
```


::: {.notes}
Sort of like how Microsoft Word will periodically save versions that you can return to.
:::

__Version control__ is a way of recording changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

Most common VC systems:

* ::: {.fragment .highlight-green}
Git 
:::
* Mercurial
* Subversion (SVN)

## Why should I use Git?
::: {style="font-size: 0.85em"}

::: {.incremental}
* _Peace of Mind_ - work is stored safely and can be easily recalled
* _Collaboration_ - multiple versions can be developed in tandem, allowing parallel feature development
* _Review and Discussion_ - GitHub allows for easy review of code changes before incorporating into the main branch of the repository
* _Documentation_ - shows when, why, and by whom specific changes were made
* _Consolidation_ - Project code and documentation can be stored in the same location.
* _Preservation and Access_ - Easy web browser access to all code versions, can control whether public or private.

## Git versus GitHub

::: {.notes}
Git works by monitoring the changes of the contents of an otherwise ordinary file folder, called a repository.
In a Git repository, a user can tell Git which file changes to keep, which to discard, and can label those changes, go back to previous file versions, and much more!
:::

![Git Logo](../../images/git-logo.png){height=0.7in}\

Git is a popular __version control system__, which is software we can download and use on our computer.

::: {.fragment}
![GitHub Logo](../../images/github-logo.png){height=0.7in}\

GitHub is a website that __hosts Git repositories__, and provides convenient ways to host documentation, discuss code changes, and report bugs.
:::

## How Git Works: The Big Picture

::: {.notes}
Git works by creating snapshots of your project at different points in time. Each commit represents a complete snapshot of your files. The branching system allows multiple versions to coexist and later be merged together.
:::

::: {style="overflow: hidden; height: 400px;"}
![Git Branching Structure](../../images/git-branching-diagram.png){style="margin-top: -550px; height: 800px;"}
:::

Git tracks changes by creating __commits__ - snapshots of your project that form a branching tree structure over time.

## The Git Workflow: Theory

::: {.notes}
This is the fundamental workflow you'll use repeatedly: make changes locally, stage them, commit them with a message, then push to share with others.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em"}

The basic Git workflow follows these steps:

::: {.incremental}
1. __Working Directory__ - Make changes to your files
2. __Staging Area__ - Select which changes to include (`git add`)
3. __Local Repository__ - Save a snapshot with a message (`git commit`)
4. __Remote Repository__ - Share your changes (`git push`)
:::

:::

## Additional Resources

::: {.notes}
The website contains comprehensive guides covering all these topics in detail, plus advanced workflows, best practices, and troubleshooting.

**[The tutorial](https://rff-data-projects.github.io/rff-data-gov-guidance/docs/version-control/tutorial-basics.html)** available on the RFF data guidance website covers topics from this presentation in greater depth.

## Git Bash {auto-animate="true"}

There are many ways of using the Git software, but we will focus on __Git Bash__, a command line Git interface that comes with Git.

First, open Git Bash.  (Hit the windows key and type "bash")

Let's start by asking Git what version we are running:

```bash
$ git --version
```

## Git Bash {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
Git Bash is __one__ way to access Git.
It is not the only way, nor necessarily the way you will always use.
Many common code editors like RStudio and Visual Studio Code have some form of Git interface built in, and you may consider using those.
For the tutorial, however, we will focus on Git Bash because it comes with Git and it is good for teaching the fundamentals of Git.

git version 2.47.0.windows.2
```

## Introduce Yourself to Git

Now, let's enter the following commands

```bash
$ git config --global user.name 'Your Name Here'
$ git config --global user.email 'your-name-here@rff.org'
```

Now, Git will include your name and email when you publish changes!  Let's take a look at what configuration options Git has set. 

```bash
$ git config --global --list
user.name=Ethan Russell
user.email=erussell@rff.org
```

## __Creating__ a Repository in GitHub {auto-animate="true"}

1. Navigate to `github.com`, log in, and click the plus button in the top right corner

## __Creating__ a Repository in GitHub {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
GitHub provides a structure called "Organizations", which can have multiple users with different roles, and can even own repositories.  Your project teams can discuss whether or not it makes sense to have a GitHub organization.

So, for the owner, you could either select your user account, or an organization you are a member of.
The repository owner will show up in the URL of the repository
:::

1. [Navigate to `github.com`, log in, and click the plus button in the top right corner]{.semi-transparent}

2. Select the repository owner, yourself!

The owner's name will appear in the URL of the repository:

`github.com/<owner-name>/<repository-name>`

## __Creating__ a Repository in GitHub {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
We recommend all lowercase names with dashes separating words, like `my-repo-name`.
The only exception is when a programming language’s best practices prescribe a specific repository naming convention.
(i.e. julia package repositories are supposed to be camelcase as in `MyRepoName.jl`)
:::

1. [Navigate to `github.com`, log in, and click the plus button in the top right corner]{.semi-transparent}

2. [Select the repository owner, yourself!]{.semi-transparent}

3. Choose a repository name.

We recommend choosing something concise and descriptive, all lowercase, with dashes separating words, like `my-repo-name`.


## __Creating__ a Repository in GitHub {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
Generally, choose private for repositories that will contain sensitive information, and public if the project requires it to be public.
It is easy to change from private to public later on, so when in doubt choose private.

For public repositories, you would also need to select which software license to use, and you can find more information about that on the website.
:::

2. [Select the repository owner, yourself!]{.semi-transparent}

3. [Choose a repository name.]{.semi-transparent}

4. Choose whether the repository is to be public or private.

Generally, choose private for repositories that will contain sensitive information, and public if the project requires it to be public.  For today, choose private!

::: {.notes}
A `.gitignore` file specifies certain file types that Git will not track the changes of, by default.
For example, it is best to ignore an auto-created config file made by R studio that is user-specific.
Generally it is a good idea to select the .gitignore template for the programming language you will be using.

## __Cloning__ Your First Repository With Git {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
Now that we've made a remote repository, let's get it copied onto our computer.
Copying a remote Git repository is called _cloning_.
This process will work the same way for any existing repository, including the one that we just made.
:::

__Cloning__ = making a copy of a repository onto a computer.

## __Cloning__ Your First Repository With Git {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
First, it's important to choose a good file location to store the git repository.  While it's not required, many people like to have a single folder to store all of their Git repositories.  An alternative would be to store the Git repository in an associated project folder.

Git Bash has a _working directory_, which is the location that it is operating in.  To see what the current working directory is, we can enter the `pwd` command, which stands for **p**rimary **w**orking **d**irectory.
:::

1. Choose where to store the git repository and navigate there.

This could be in a dedicated "repositories" folder on your C:/ drive, or it could be within a team's project folder.

To navigate there, use the `cd` command in Git Bash:

```bash
cd `C:/Users/<my-user-name>/repos`
```
::: {.callout-note}
It is necessary to use single quotes for filenames in Git Bash if there is a space in the path.

1. [Choose where to store the git repository and navigate there.]{.semi-transparent}

2. [Copy the repository URL to the clipboard]{.semi-transparent}

3. Enter the `git clone <repo-url>` command in Git Bash.

In the Git bash window, type `git clone ` then paste in the repository URL from your clipboard by right-clicking.  Altogether this would look like:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner-name>/<repository-name>
```

You will need to enter your GitHub credentials if it is a private repository.

## Exploring Your Cloned Repository

::: {.notes}
Now that we have cloned the repository, let's explore what Git sees. The git status command is one of the most useful commands - it tells you the current state of your repository.
:::

After cloning, navigate into your repository folder:

```bash
cd <repository-name>
```

Now let's check the status of our repository:

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This tells us we're on the main branch and everything is up to date!

## Making Changes

::: {.notes}
Now let's make a change to our repository and learn how to commit it. We'll edit the README file to add some content.
:::

Let's make a change to the README.md file. Open it in a text editor and add some content:

```markdown
# My First Repository

This is my first Git repository for learning version control!
```

Now let's see what Git thinks about our changes:

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        modified:   README.md
```

## Staging Changes with `git add`

::: {.notes}
Before we can commit changes, we need to stage them. This tells Git which changes we want to include in our next commit.
:::

Git detected our changes! Now we need to __stage__ them before committing:

```bash
$ git add README.md
```

Let's check the status again:

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.md
```

Our changes are now staged and ready to commit!

## Creating a Commit with `git commit`

::: {.notes}
A commit creates a permanent snapshot of the staged changes along with a descriptive message explaining what was changed and why.
:::

Now let's create a commit with a descriptive message:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Add description to README file"
[main a1b2c3d] Add description to README file
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
```

Let's check our status again:

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Sharing Changes with `git push`

::: {.notes}
Our commit exists locally, but we need to push it to GitHub so others can see our changes and so they're backed up remotely.
:::

Our local repository now has changes that aren't on GitHub yet. Let's __push__ them:

```bash
$ git push
Counting objects: 3, done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 285 bytes | 285.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/<owner-name>/<repository-name>
   def456g..a1b2c3d  main -> main
```

Now let's check our status one final time:

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Perfect! Our changes are now saved both locally and on GitHub.
