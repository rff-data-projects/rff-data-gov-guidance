## What is Version Control?

```{=html}
<style>
.semi-transparent {
  opacity: 0.4;
}
.no-bullets {
  list-style: none !important;
  list-style-type: none !important;
}
.no-bullets li {
  list-style: none !important;
  list-style-type: none !important;
  margin-left: 0 !important;
  padding-left: 0 !important;
}
.no-bullets li::before {
  content: none !important;
}
.no-bullets li::marker {
  content: none !important;
}
</style>
```


::: {.notes}
Sort of like how Microsoft Word will periodically save versions that you can return to.
:::

__Version control__ is a way of recording changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

The most common VC systems are:

* ::: {.fragment .highlight-green}
Git 
:::
* Mercurial
* Subversion (SVN)

## Why should I use Git and GitHub?
::: {style="font-size: 0.85em"}

::: {.incremental}
* _Peace of Mind_ - work is stored safely and can be easily recalled
* _Collaboration_ - multiple versions can be developed in tandem, allowing parallel feature development
* _Review and Discussion_ - GitHub allows for easy review of code changes before incorporating into the main branch of the repository
* _Documentation_ - shows when, why, and by whom specific changes were made
* _Consolidation_ - Project code and documentation can be stored in the same location.
* _Preservation and Access_ - Easy web browser access to all code versions, can control whether public or private.

## Git versus GitHub

::: {.notes}
Git works by monitoring the changes of the contents of an otherwise ordinary file folder, called a repository.
In a Git repository, a user can tell Git which file changes to keep, which to discard, and can label those changes, go back to previous file versions, and much more!
:::

![Git Logo](../../images/git-logo.png){height=0.7in}\

Git is a popular __version control system__, which is software we can download and use on our computer.

::: {.fragment}
![GitHub Logo](../../images/github-logo.png){height=0.7in}\

GitHub is a website that __hosts Git repositories__, and provides convenient ways to host documentation, discuss code changes, and report bugs.
:::

## The basic Git workflow

::: {.notes}
This is the fundamental workflow you'll use repeatedly: make changes locally, stage them, commit them with a message, then push to share with others.
:::

Minimalist Git use in your coding workflow involves only a few concepts, all of which we'll cover today:

::: {.incremental}
1. __Repository__ - A folder for storing code, with a special subdirectory containing the Git magic
2. __Staging__ - Reviewing your changes and selecting which ones to "`add`"
3. __Local Copy__ - A copy (clone) of the repository on your computer where you "`commit`" your changes
4. __Remote Copy__ - The copy of the repo on a server (GitHub) where you "`push`" your changes to share them with others

## In practice {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
Git works by creating snapshots of your project at different points in time. The branching system allows multiple versions to coexist and later be merged together.
:::

The repository accumulates changes incrementally as you build upon the project.

::: {.notes}
Git works by creating snapshots of your project at different points in time. The branching system allows multiple versions to coexist and later be merged together.
:::

Unlike a system that archives versions of entire files or folders, Git is space-efficient.

::: {.fragment}
Each time you `commit` changes, only insertions and deletions are tracked by Git, along with information about their location within the repository.
:::

## In practice {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
Git works by creating snapshots of your project at different points in time. Each commit represents a complete snapshot of your files. The branching system allows multiple versions to coexist and later be merged together.
:::

Git makes it easy to `checkout` past versions of code, which can be helpful when you need to undo changes or figure out why your current code doesn't work.

::: aside
Branching will be covered in the next workshop. See **[the RFF data guidance tutorial](https://rff-data-projects.github.io/rff-data-gov-guidance/docs/version-control/tutorial-branching.html)** if you want to learn more in the meantime.

## Git Bash {auto-animate="true"}

There are many ways of using the Git software, but we will focus on __Git Bash__, a command line Git interface that comes with Git.

First, open Git Bash.  (Hit the windows key and type "bash")

## Git Bash {auto-animate="true"}

There are many ways of using the Git software, but we will focus on __Git Bash__, a command line Git interface that comes with Git.

First, open Git Bash.  (Hit the windows key and type "bash")

Let's start by asking Git what version we are running:

```bash
$ git --version
```

## Git Bash {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
Git Bash is __one__ way to access Git.
It is not the only way, nor necessarily the way you will always use.
Many common code editors like RStudio and Visual Studio Code have some form of Git interface built in, and you may consider using those.
For the tutorial, however, we will focus on Git Bash because it comes with Git and it is good for teaching the fundamentals of Git.

## Introduce Yourself to Git {auto-animate="true"}

1. First, check if Git is already configured:

```bash
$ git config --global --list
```

If you see existing username and email settings, you can skip the next step.

## Introduce Yourself to Git {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
Replace the example username and email with your own GitHub username and email address.
:::

1. [First, check if Git is already configured:]{.semi-transparent}

2. Configure using your username and email (if needed):

```bash
$ git config --global user.name 'jmwingenroth'
$ git config --global user.email 'my_github_account_email@aol.com'
```

::: aside
It is best to use the same username and email as your GitHub account to keep them consistent.

## __Creating__ a Repository in GitHub {auto-animate="true"}

1. Navigate to `github.com`, log in, and click the plus button in the top right corner

![Creating a Repository](../../images/git-create-repo.png)\

## __Creating__ a Repository in GitHub {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
GitHub provides a structure called "Organizations", which can have multiple users with different roles, and can even own repositories.  Your project teams can discuss whether or not it makes sense to have a GitHub organization.

So, for the owner, you could either select your user account, or an organization you are a member of.
The repository owner will show up in the URL of the repository
:::

1. [Navigate to `github.com`, log in, and click the plus button in the top right corner]{.semi-transparent}

2. Select the repository owner, yourself!

The owner's name will appear in the URL of the repository:

`github.com/jmwingenroth/repository-name`

## __Creating__ a Repository in GitHub {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
We recommend all lowercase names with dashes separating words, like `my-repo-name`.
The only exception is when a programming language’s best practices prescribe a specific repository naming convention.
(i.e. julia package repositories are supposed to be camelcase as in `MyRepoName.jl`)
:::

1. [Navigate to `github.com`, log in, and click the plus button in the top right corner]{.semi-transparent}

2. [Select the repository owner, yourself!]{.semi-transparent}

3. Choose a repository name.

We recommend choosing something concise and descriptive, all lowercase, with dashes separating words, like `my-repo-name`.


## __Creating__ a Repository in GitHub {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
Generally, choose private for repositories that will contain sensitive information, and public if the project requires it to be public.
It is easy to change from private to public later on, so when in doubt choose private.

For public repositories, you would also need to select which software license to use, and you can find more information about that on the website.
:::

1. [Navigate to `github.com`, log in, and click the plus button in the top right corner]{.semi-transparent}

2. [Select the repository owner, yourself!]{.semi-transparent}

3. [Choose a repository name.]{.semi-transparent}

4. Choose whether the repository is to be public or private.

Generally, choose private for repositories that will contain sensitive information, and public if the project requires it to be public. __For today, choose private.__

## __Creating__ a Repository in GitHub {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
This will create a file called `README.md` located in the repository's root folder, where you can later add basic documentation for the repository.
:::

1. [Navigate to `github.com`, log in, and click the plus button in the top right corner]{.semi-transparent}

2. [Select the repository owner, yourself!]{.semi-transparent}

3. [Choose a repository name.]{.semi-transparent}

4. [Choose whether the repository is to be public or private.]{.semi-transparent}

5. Check the box to add a README file.

We will use this to store documentation for the repository.

## __Creating__ a Repository in GitHub {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
A `.gitignore` file specifies certain file types that Git will not track the changes of, by default.
For example, it is best to ignore an auto-created config file made by R studio that is user-specific.
Generally it is a good idea to select the .gitignore template for the programming language you will be using.
:::

1. [Navigate to `github.com`, log in, and click the plus button in the top right corner]{.semi-transparent}

2. [Select the repository owner, yourself!]{.semi-transparent}

4. [Choose whether the repository is to be public or private.]{.semi-transparent}

5. [Check the box to add a README file.]{.semi-transparent}

6. Choose a `.gitignore` template from the dropdown menu.

Select the .gitignore template for the programming language you will be using. Any language works for today.

## __Creating__ a Repository in GitHub {auto-animate="true"}

## __Cloning__ Your First Repository With Git {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
Now that we've made a remote repository, let's get it copied onto our computer.
Copying a remote Git repository is called _cloning_.
This process will work the same way for any existing repository, including the one that we just made.
:::

__Cloning__ = making a copy of a repository on your computer

## __Cloning__ Your First Repository With Git {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
First, it's important to choose a good file location to store the git repository.  While it's not required, many people like to have a single folder to store all of their Git repositories.  An alternative would be to store the Git repository in an associated project folder.

Git Bash has a _working directory_, which is the location that it is operating in.  To see what the current working directory is, we can enter the `pwd` command, which stands for **p**rimary **w**orking **d**irectory.
:::

1. Copy the repository URL to the clipboard.

From the repository home page, click the green button, then copy the URL to clipboard by clicking the logo with intersecting squares.

![](../../images/git-clone-3.png)

## __Cloning__ Your First Repository With Git {auto-animate="true"}

1. [Copy the repository URL to the clipboard.]{.semi-transparent}

2. Create a folder called "repos"

Open File Explorer, navigate to the folder where you'd like to store your code, create a folder named `repos`, and copy the file path using the right-click menu.

Then, navigate there using the `cd` command in Git Bash:

```bash
cd C:/Users/Jordan/repos
```

::: aside
For today, put this somewhere on your local hard drive. However, the data governance website provides guidelines for an [L:/ drive team project folder hierarchy](https://rff-data-projects.github.io/rff-data-gov-guidance/docs/data-management/organization.html#sec-directory-structure) that is recommended for actual Git implementations.

:::

## __Cloning__ Your First Repository With Git {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
:::

1. [Copy the repository URL to the clipboard.]{.semi-transparent} 

2. [Choose where to store the git repository and navigate there.]{.semi-transparent} 

3. Enter the `git clone <repo-url>` command in Git Bash.

::: {.notes}
Replace the example URL with your actual repository URL from your clipboard.
:::

In the Git bash window, type `git clone ` then paste in the repository URL from your clipboard by right-clicking:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmwingenroth/my-first-repo
```
::: aside
Since we set the repository to "private", you may be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials.
:::

## Exploring Your Cloned Repository

::: {.notes}
Now that we have cloned the repository, let's explore what Git sees. The git status command is one of the most useful commands - it tells you the current state of your repository.
:::

After cloning, navigate into your repository folder:

```bash
cd <repository-name>
```

Now let's check the status of our repository:

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This tells us we're on the main branch and everything is up to date!

## Making Changes

::: {.notes}
Now let's make a change to our repository and learn how to commit it. We'll edit the README file to add some content.
:::

Let's make a change to the README.md file. Open it in a text editor and add some content:

```markdown
# My First Repository

This is my first Git repository for learning version control!
```

Now let's see what Git thinks about our changes:

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md
```

## Viewing Changes with `git diff`

::: {.notes}
Before staging changes, it's often helpful to review exactly what has changed in your files. The git diff command shows you the specific lines that were added, removed, or modified.
:::

To see the specific changes you made, use `git diff`:

```bash
$ git diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index e69de29..9f4d96d 100644
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md
@@ -0,0 +1,2 @@
 # My First Repository
+
+This is my first Git repository for learning version control!
```

The output shows lines added (in green with `+`) and lines removed (in red with `-`), as well as the unchanged title line that GitHub added automatically.

## Staging Changes with `git add`

::: {.notes}
Before we can commit changes, we need to stage them. This tells Git which changes we want to include in our next commit.
:::

Git detected our changes! Now we need to __stage__ them before committing:

```bash
$ git add README.md
```

Let's check the status again:

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.md
```

Our changes are now staged and ready to commit!

## Creating a Commit with `git commit`

::: {.notes}
A commit creates a permanent snapshot of the staged changes along with a descriptive message explaining what was changed and why.
:::

Now let's create a commit with a descriptive message:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Add description to README file"
[main a1b2c3d] Add description to README file
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

Let's check our status again:

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Sharing Changes with `git push` {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}
Our commit exists locally, but we need to push it to GitHub so others can see our changes and so they're backed up remotely.
:::

Our local repository now has changes that aren't on GitHub yet. Let's `push` them:

```bash
$ git push
```

## Sharing Changes with `git push` {auto-animate="true"}

::: {.notes}

:::

Our local repository now has changes that aren't on GitHub yet. Let's `push` them:

```

::: aside
The text response may vary slightly depending on your Git version. So long as there are no obvious errors, you are fine for today.
:::

## Sharing Changes with `git push`

Now let's check our status one final time:

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

::: {.fragment}
Perfect! Our changes are now saved both locally and on GitHub. Open or refresh the repo page in your web browser to see the changes.
:::

## Recap

::: {.notes}
You've learned the fundamental Git workflow that you'll use daily. Remember that Git is a powerful tool that becomes easier with practice. The key is to commit early and often with clear, descriptive messages.
:::

At this point you should have:

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
* ✓ Created a repository on GitHub
* ✓ Cloned it to your local machine
* ✓ Made changes to files
* ✓ Staged changes with `git add`
* ✓ Committed changes with `git commit`
* ✓ Pushed changes to GitHub with `git push`
* ✓ Given yourself a pat on the back! 🎉
